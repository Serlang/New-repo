Farewell to all the earthly remains.
No burdens, no further debts to be paid.
Atlas may rest his weary bones.
Weight of the world...
All falls away
In time...

Goodbye to all the plans that we made.
No contracts - I'm free to do as I may.
No hunger, no sleep except to dream...
Mild and warm,
Safe from all harm,
Calm...
