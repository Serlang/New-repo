Why should I play this game of pretend
Remembering through a second-hand sorrow?
Such a great son and wonderful friend,
Oh don't the tears just pour!

I could curl up and hide in my room,
There in my bed, still sobbing tomorrow;
I could give in to all of the gloom
But tell me... Tell me what for?


Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I say I keep you with me?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?
Why should I play a grieving girl and lie,
Saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light?
I will sing no requiem tonight.


I gave you the world - you threw it away
Leaving these broken pieces behind you.
Everything wasted, nothing to say,
So I can sing no requiem.

I hear your voice, I feel you near.
Within these words I finally find you.
And now that I know that you are still here, 
I will sing no requiem tonight!


Why should I have a heavy heart?
Why should I say I keep you with me?
Why should I go and fall apart for you?
Why should I play a grieving girl and lie,
Saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark without your light (I can see your light...)
I will sing no requiem tonight!


'Cause when the villains fall, the kingdoms never weep,
No one lights a candle to remember.
No, no one mourns at all
When they lay down to sleep!
So, don't tell me that I didn't have it right!
Don't tell me that it wasn't black and white!
After all you put me through
Don't say it wasn't true!
That you were not the monster
That I knew...


'Cause I cannot play a grieving girl and lie,
Saying that I miss you
And that my world has gone dark...

I will sing no requiem...
I will sing no requiem...
I will sing no requiem
Tonight.
